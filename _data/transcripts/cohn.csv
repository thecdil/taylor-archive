Teresa Cohn,[00:00:00:00],00:00:40:22,"Okay. I'm Teresa Cohn and I have to think, yeah, the first time I was at Taylor was through the McCall art or Science school. And so I was first there with a group of students, do you want a year? Probably doesn't matter. Let's see. It would have been 2011, maybe. No, that's not right at all. Sorry. That's totally not right. 2015.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:00:40:23],00:00:49:10,2015. Yeah. And so I traveled in with a group of graduate students for the McCall Outdoor Science School.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:00:49:12],00:00:53:19,We would talk about it. Really want to know about it?,
Jack Kredell,[00:00:53:21],00:01:00:05,How? That was the first time you visited Taylor?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:01:00:07],00:01:16:21,"Yeah. I think I'm trying to think here. I think that's right. I think I flew in, in charge of a group of students straight off the bat. I'm pretty sure. Yeah.",
Jack Kredell,[00:01:16:23],00:01:17:17,From us.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:01:17:19],00:01:18:23,From us?,
Jack Kredell,[00:01:19:01],00:01:25:05,"Yeah. And then later on, you. You were more involved.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:01:25:07],00:01:54:12,"That's right. Yeah. So every in that became kind of instantly. I mean, I would say the first time I was it, too. I came from Montana, and even within a few minutes of landing at Taylor, I just had the sense of it. To me, it felt a lot like Yellowstone in terms of just the level, how the wildness felt very similar to me to being in Yellowstone and and from the get go.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:01:54:12],00:02:30:12,"It was a amazing place to teach. And it was a place where, you know, you sort of have to, I think, just for me to teach, whether you really do monitor how much of yourself to put in and how much of yourself to remove, because I think if you're doing your job, the place is teaching, you know, and so you're just sort of facilitating this process of students really being able to deeply engage with a place that can be certainly inspiring but also incredibly agitating.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:02:30:15],00:02:42:17,Right. And so you're managing that for students in the sort of profound learning experiences that that can happen there when things are going well.,wonder
Jack Kredell,[00:02:42:19],00:02:46:12,What is the place teaching then?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:02:46:14],00:03:20:00,"I mean, this is to me really a question of what's the what's the worth of this as an educational experience? And I think there are many things that you can learn at Taylor, but the rarity of it is that I think it's a place that's so different than a college campus in that it's integrated learning whether you like it or not.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:03:20:01],00:03:38:13,"Right. And so you're learning all kinds of things. You're certainly learning about, you know, the science that we would intend to happen there. It was just happen to Taylor for years and years and years. But I'm also interested in all the other things are getting learned in the process, which is how to function in the community, what is designated wilderness, how do we inhabit this place?",community;wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:03:38:15],00:04:16:05,"What is it like to inhabit a landscape with predators? How is it to move through the landscape differently? And I think all of these, you know, we might say in you know, in academic language, this is interdisciplinary, but I think it's more profound than that. It's a for asked students to be different in the world because that's what the place asks of them.",wonder
Jack Kredell,[00:04:16:07],00:04:17:06,That makes me think of wilderness doctrine and.,
Jack Kredell,[00:04:25:02],00:04:57:01,"With the exception of the station manager, Taylor is a place where man is but a visitor in the sense that Taylor is a place of comings and goings. Students arriving, students leaving, researchers arriving and leaving. And so I. I wonder what people take back from Taylor. Like what? What sticks with you when you leave Taylor? When you're far from Taylor?",
Jack Kredell,[00:04:57:02],00:05:00:04,"Like, how. How how does Taylor stay with you, do you think?",
Teresa Cohn,[00:05:01:10],00:05:43:16,"Yeah, that's a good question. I might backtrack a little bit and say one of the things that Taylor does well is help us have personal experiences of time beyond our own geological landscape. Hydrological landscape, cultural landscape. Right. And so I think to when I'm at Taylor, there's so much duku dika present still in that landscape that it reminds us that actually this time of comings and goings, it's brief.",
Jack Kredell,[00:05:43:18],00:05:48:11,What do you see when you when you step out the front door?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:05:48:14],00:06:22:05,"Delves is that where we are? Yeah the hay meadow obviously in front and you sort of feel everything to your back, which would be Pioneer Creek going up to Dave Lewis, that whole basin. I mean I sort of in my mind would see snow on Dave Lewis. and then the, the ridgelines wrapping around down to the Hay Meadow out front beyond the hay meadow, Big Creek, the bridge, certainly the vegetation along Big creek.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:06:22:07],00:06:47:22,"Well the solar panels and the energy, the whole place. You know, I guess when you're when you're out at Taylor and you're sort of like monitoring the place, that's a really important keeping the energy up, you know, the Internet, where all that happens and then across to, you know, across the bridge and out to the benches, you know, that kind of like stack up.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:06:47:22],00:07:15:20,"And then and then beyond that, you know, we like two summers ago, I guess, flew in to Cold Meadows and hiked maybe 20, 25 miles down. And so now, like this fast and some Jim and Hollywood have this more. It's all those people who have on their feet gone back with see have this thing sort of like layered beyond that.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:07:15:20],00:07:44:18,"It has like layered memory of everything that we've seen, you know, back in there, some really amazing country. Once you get up high and can look around and then, you know, once you're up that high, there's sort of a geography of the middle fork and and the way that it curves around the salmon and sort of how that then expands into this great wilderness, you know, the Frank Church River of No return.",wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:07:57:03],00:08:15:00,"Or. Not always, but I mean, most of the time trying to think of ever back there and not once. Once I was probably back there. Not responsible for a group of students. No, that's not true. That's not true at all. No. We went back when Megan Pete left the caretakers. There was a gap where we were filling in caretaking.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:08:15:00],00:08:42:02,"So I was there probably for a month on and off, one break and in there, I was back during COVID for a month cleaning out the lab, all the stuff that had piled up over years and years and years, which was amazing and disgusting and yeah, all kinds of stories, you know, in all of the things that people left behind.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:08:44:23],00:08:59:06,"and I went, I've been back on research trips too. Yeah. So with just researchers and not students. So actually it's interesting, but probably I've spent more time back there with that students than with now that I think about it.",
Jack Kredell,[00:08:59:08],00:09:04:17,"Well, what was that like managing Taylor day to day as a as a caretaker?",
Teresa Cohn,[00:09:04:19],00:09:46:12,"I mean, a short stint for me, right? We're saying, how long was I doing that for? I mean, like three weeks a month, you know, So relative to John Payton and, you know, Megan, Pete and all the folks that have spent time back there, mine was a very different experience as an academic, though, right? As a professor, it was really refreshing to tend to the basics, right, to really have to learn how to keep solar going, you know, And actually, now that I am reflecting on probably one of most profound experiences that Taylor was when Pete got hurt and had to be airlifted, life flighted to Boise.",wonder;aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:09:46:12],00:10:08:23,"And we flew in, Mark and I and our daughter young, she was little just like three flew in in the middle of winter. And, you know, if you really think about water, you have to really think about energy in the middle of winter. So that was in a way enlightening and refreshing because I think a lot of times, you know, especially when you're like a professor and not, you know, director, anything like that kind of protected.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:10:08:23],00:10:27:09,"You're buffered from all of that. But it was great. I loved learning. I mean, yeah, learning how to move the airstrip, you know, I love that. And I mean, you have to look at the years. I will never look at the airstrip the same way again, like where the dense are, where the rocks are that you can't hit, you know, all the ways that you have to maneuver the mower when you're moving through that place.",aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:10:27:09],00:10:38:10,"I, I, I really like that. You think about pack rats, you know, you think about it's a different relationship to that place that I found expansive. Yeah. And again, refreshing.",
Jack Kredell,[00:10:38:12],00:10:42:15,Did you ever have to knock ice off the water box?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:10:43:13],00:11:08:11,"yes. Yeah. The slush. Ice. Yeah. That would get caught in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was one of Jim's, favorite pastimes. did he like to do that? I would think so. I think he hated it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a different place. And we were not there in the. In the deep, dark. You know, I can't remember when we flew in, but it was not, you know, it's nothing compared to what the winter caretakers do.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:11:08:12],00:11:16:01,"You know, I have a healthy respect for people who, who spend the whole year there.",
Jack Kredell,[00:11:16:03],00:11:21:00,Yeah. I mean it would be like The Shining for me.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:11:21:02],00:11:40:15,"Yeah. I mean, I think that some of the folks in here in back there too, this is like the wildlife interaction. Amazing. You know, we were there in October. This is what'll happen when you touch worse than Gary if you let him start going. Like the stories, people just tell long stories about this place. There's a kill on the airstrip.",aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:11:40:15],00:11:51:17,"When we were there, it was pretty amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And winter, wintertime, it all comes closer in, you know, the fewer people there.",
Jack Kredell,[00:11:51:19],00:11:57:07,So can you talk about it? to kill. Is that what you're talking about?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:11:57:10],00:12:29:03,"Yeah. Yeah, It was a deer. It was a doe. We think about it. Yeah. yeah. So, one second, Mike. Doris. Like, probably not supposed to. She's my favorite pilot out there. He. He had flown in. We were there. I don't know if he's bringing in. No, he must've been bring. I can't remember who was coming and going at that time, but we got out of the plane and it kind of scratches his head like he does, you know, like messes with his hat.",aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:12:29:03],00:12:57:13,"And he's like, Yeah, I think. I think I. I think I hit something down there on the airstrip. You might want to check it out, you know? And so, and so he flew off and, and we walked down and, and it was the gut pile of the steer had been, like, disemboweled, and the intestines were, like, strung across the airstrip, you know, and, and, you know, then it's like the tail or things like, what happened in.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:12:57:13],00:13:19:14,"It's like this mystery that then you're trying to untangle and you're looking for. Is it a cat? Is it wolf? Is it, you know? And so then, you know, took us a while to put the pieces together and we're writing emails to Jim and Holly and like, you know, reporting in and sending pictures and wrote to Sophie Gilbert, who had her theory, which was some sort of combination of bear and cougar, because of the way that things were strewn around.",wolves;cougars
Teresa Cohn,[00:13:19:14],00:13:43:20,"Jim and Holly really went for Wolf, you know, and then you're watching, you know, and everything changes. Everything changed overnight. You know, the deer, you know, the like Taylor deer that would hang around and eat apples and all that. Like the Taylor pack. They were gone. Just gone. You know, there was one little fawn that was running around the farm, the mother that died, you know, just sort of calling and calling and calling, you know.",wolves
Teresa Cohn,[00:13:43:22],00:14:07:06,"But the it was quieter. It was this changed, you know, And then, you know, probably two days later, one of our students went up towards the fire lookout, actually by Rush Creek and came around the corner by the Sage flat. And this place was Wolf. Yeah. But then both of them, I think, you know, had like the sort of eye lock.",wolves
Teresa Cohn,[00:14:07:07],00:14:39:16,"And then they scattered the will ran, and then we saw more, Wolf, than, you know. So I think that's sort of the theory settled in on Wolf and and wolf kill on the airstrip and, you know, cold coldness stories about being down on the South Beach. And you'll see all these places in winter when a where he saw deer wolf interaction right there on the ice, you know.",wolves;aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:14:39:18],00:14:56:08,"But yeah, a lot of that that big world comes in in the winter and yeah think shift and you get to watch that you know the dynamics of the whole place change.",
Jack Kredell,[00:14:56:10],00:14:59:07,Are there any other memorable wildlife encounters.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:14:59:14],00:15:35:15,"yeah. Every time you go back there, there's something. Yeah. So I think especially, I think it's the ones that instantly jump into my mind. I don't know. Was thinking like otters and minks and. But twice down at the home site, Jim Kingery would call it like downstream, a little bit around the corner. First time I was like animals constraints, classes like teaching.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:15:35:17],00:15:51:00,"And then the first time bighorn sheep came down right off the ridge, you know, right down towards us. So you know, you sort of sit and watch this happen. And I remember sort of saying quietly, is this is the first time any of you've seen Bighorn Sheep? And there's a young woman who's like, Yeah, and I've never seen an eagle either.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:15:51:00],00:16:22:02,"In the it was like an eagle circling overhead, you know, So really profound experiences for students who haven't ever interacted with these kinds of beings before. And a bear. Another times is different Year Bear came down across the river and which kind of helped class with this bear like rooting around and flipping rocks and things like that. So it's yeah, you know, and again like that, it sort of shifts everything about the way that you're interacting to have that happening around you as part of your experience, your learning experience.",wonder
Teresa Cohn,[00:16:22:04],00:16:48:20,"And then wolf, bighorn, you guys also, Yeah, lots and lots of wildlife interactions with students. And I and you know, again, this is not Jim in Hollywood have so many so many, you know, and I'm trying to think, you know, mine are like seven years of working with students back there. That's relative to the amount of time terminology I've spent.",wolves
Teresa Cohn,[00:16:48:20],00:16:56:21,"Like, that's nothing. You know, it's nothing. But every single time that you're there, you know, it's not like you count on it, but something happens.",
Jack Kredell,[00:16:56:23],00:17:04:09,"Yeah, it's it's interesting hearing you.",
Jack Kredell,[00:17:04:11],00:17:14:21,Talk about Taylor. I don't know. You.,
Jack Kredell,[00:17:15:02],00:17:22:22,"You talk about Taylor as though, the people associated with.",
Jack Kredell,[00:17:22:22],00:17:27:19,Taylor are part of its physical environment. Like.,
Jack Kredell,[00:17:27:20],00:17:36:06,It feels like in your head. Gym hallways. Yeah. Called in gym. Part of its physical geography.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:17:36:08],00:18:08:12,"It's a community. Yeah. Yeah. Can you say more about that? Yeah. I mean, I think the people that stick around the Taylor pretty committed to that place. And even if you don't overlap with some you since that community it's like it's like wandering into the orchard when you're back there and they're these trees and you know somebody planted them you're grateful that somebody planted them.",community
Teresa Cohn,[00:18:08:14],00:18:37:01,"You don't know who it is. I can make some guesses in this case, like a handful of people that could have done that or added to them or whatever. But you know that it's a community that's larger than your now. And and yet to me, it seems very part of the landscape. Janet Pope, she spent a ton of time back there, you know, and then all the people that I can't name that I know who've come and gone.",community
Teresa Cohn,[00:18:37:01],00:19:18:07,"Yeah, yeah. No, I think it's very much a community. And you know, more than that to me, I probably have different take on this than somebody like Benjamin, Holly and Colden. And, you know, coming from a different background, I'm not like a bighorn sheep scientist or anything like that, but their commune, their communal research projects that I would say, whether they're named and recognized or not, I love some Colden's work on thinking about how dynamic that place is and how it's dynamism is linked to its diversity biodiversity, especially the stream ecology world of things.",community;creativity
Teresa Cohn,[00:19:18:09],00:19:49:19,"You know, in the photo work we were thinking about change in a different way. But I think there's a common conversation in the Taylor community that's about change and whether you're coming from humanist perspectives, social scientists, or whether you're a stream ecologist, that's a great place to really engage with changing landscape, you know, whether it's the change that's necessary to maintain that kind of ecosystem, whether it's climate change.",community;perspective
Teresa Cohn,[00:19:49:19],00:20:16:19,"On top of that, the share who he's working with or Mary Ingles or whether it's the change, you know, in the last hundred years, it's a place in which we as a common community can think about that as a body of questioning, you know, that I think is robust in really what we would call and, you know, interdisciplinary or integrated ways, you know, across the landscape.",community
Teresa Cohn,[00:20:16:19],00:21:15:23,"And I think Taylor has huge potential for that kind of work in a creative research community. Water I talked to Maurice a little bit about this, too. You know, your passion, salmon they're incredible stories about connectivity from Taylor to the Atlantic, you know, and the ways in which these fluid ecosystems kind of connect communities across it. I just think there's a lot of a lot of potential to keep building around some of these research themes and like go back in mind some of the research that's been done to to see like what part covers the common conversation has dropped off for ten years and we need to pick up again, you know, no matter what",community;creativity
Teresa Cohn,[00:21:15:23],00:21:21:19,the discipline is.,
Jack Kredell,[00:21:21:21],00:21:38:18,"Taylor as a site of change, is a common theme that comes up in these interviews. Yeah. So it's so interesting because it does kind of go against this idea of wilderness that you get from reading the doctrine. I guess.",government
Teresa Cohn,[00:21:38:20],00:21:39:06,Yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:21:39:09],00:21:43:07,"As this place that is untrammeled by man, that's kind of.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:21:43:09],00:22:11:05,"Eternal and wild. Yeah, It's so dynamic. You know, anybody who spent time there, you know, it's such a dynamic kind of agitating farm and big ways, you know, it's like, you know, in. Right, that memory of mine was not even then about like landslides, which you always hear when you're back there after a rain event or, you know, whole river changing colors overnight because of the a rain event upstream or, you know, there's things that are constantly changing.",wonder
Teresa Cohn,[00:22:11:05],00:22:37:02,"The one that I was thinking about is Holly's story about the fire ripping through there. You know, it is a it's a very dynamic place. You don't have to spend that much time there to really feel the intensity of that kind of change. Yeah, it's a and I think again, like around here in the West, when we're talking about change, it's like who's moving in what?",wildfire
Teresa Cohn,[00:22:37:02],00:23:02:13,"Houses are getting built. It's a different scale and pace of change. It's different kind of change. And Taylor allows a unique kind of lens into that dynamism and what kind of almost like scales of change, what's the continuum of change? What kinds of change are we talking about? It's incredible place to engage with those questions.",creativity
Jack Kredell,[00:23:02:15],00:23:08:20,"What do you think we can learn from from that experience and those questions? I mean, as students.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:23:09:00],00:23:39:17,"Yeah, I mean, I am a geographer. And so, I mean, people have all kinds of questions about the Watson house and for me it's a where like the fundamental question is, where are we? Where are we? What is this place? Where are we? You know, and and really, I think it helps us know where we are and who we are in the where we are.",
Jack Kredell,[00:23:39:19],00:23:48:01,That's a question that has long obsessed me also; When when are we?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:23:48:01],00:24:20:09,"Yeah. This is also a good question. This is a good question. And I mean, here's another thing about to ask. Go back to like the time conversation, just like one of my favorite things to think about right now, just space Temporalities is her sort of like sense of this thing. Well, maybe I've already said this, Taylor Really?",
Teresa Cohn,[00:24:20:09],00:24:42:09,"Because we are stepping and this is very wilderness. See, we're stepping out of our sort of day to day containers. We can think we have the capacity to imagine other kinds of times and experience other kinds of times and other kinds of spaces, you know, the way that the ship to do a deal of time speaks to your time isn't that distant.",wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:24:42:11],00:25:03:15,"My gosh, it's a blink compared to geologic time, Right? The kind of work circuits he's doing. If you talked to her, I think her ground water work is amazing. So trying to understand how long the groundwater is sitting in these underground reservoirs. So the time in which it goes into the ground comes up in Springs, it's a totally different kind of time.",water
Teresa Cohn,[00:25:03:15],00:25:27:11,"Right. And the time with like the clock is water as it moves underground. It's an incredible way of experiencing time in a place like that. And again, you can access these like you were expanded in your thinking by the community of research, right? So another thing we should be doing at Taylor, supporting a robust community of research, right.",community
Teresa Cohn,[00:25:27:13],00:25:46:13,"In this means and Colton would say this too, and I would say those dinnertime conversations critical that campfire that sitting there critical right. That's where this information gets changed. That's why I can say, you know, what Sara Godsey's doing, you know what Colton's doing right. And then we have this common conversation and the more diverse the people are around that campfire, I think the more interesting it gets.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:25:46:15],00:26:04:23,"You know, even with outfitters factor, they know a ton, right? The people that walk along that trail, that's a part of the community of not necessarily Taylor but Big Creek that's its own community too. Right. And Taylor interacts with that community. But but it also is its own community.",community
Jack Kredell,[00:26:05:01],00:26:11:01,"Yeah. That in a way, Taylor has long been a kind of campfire.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:26:11:02],00:26:12:02,But yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:26:12:04],00:26:46:13,"It's always an interest to human beings. Yeah, I mean, for as long as humans were in that region, thousands of years humans have been drawn to that specific location of. Taylor. Yeah. and have been having conversations like that right in the same space. I wonder what it is about Taylor's physical, but also its immaterial geography that that tends to hold people there.",wonder;indigenous
Teresa Cohn,[00:26:47:19],00:27:07:01,"Yeah. You know, I bet, you know, it would be interesting. So it sounds like you're asking this geography question to of like, what do you see when you walk a day? So you have people orient themselves. I don't know if everybody orients themselves from Dave Lewis. I bet people I bet most people would talk about water, you know, and the streams and what's happening.",water;
Teresa Cohn,[00:27:07:03],00:27:16:06,"But you know Cliff Creek coming down pioneer Creek, Fish Creek, it's like the place where water comes together. Yeah, Yeah.",

Teresa Cohn,[00:27:17:17],00:27:28:16,It's confluence. It's confluence. That's right. That's a great metaphor for it. Yeah. Yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:27:28:18],00:27:32:16,So we can. We can wrap up soon.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:27:32:18],00:27:37:06,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.",
Jack Kredell,[00:27:37:08],00:27:40:09,What kind of future do you do you want to see for? Taylor?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:27:40:11],00:28:32:16,"Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah, I can give you the easy version first that I think the best stewardship of that place is really supporting that creative community in a very sort of not simple financial way. Making sure Taylor has enough money to operate year round and support barebones people to maintain it. You know, because that's what the creative community will rely on.",community;creativity
Teresa Cohn,[00:28:32:18],00:28:52:20,"And then a step up from that for a lot of us to be thinking like, I think what are the things that we ought to be working on or what are the common conversations and what are the critical issues of our time that can only be answered and engaged in it? Taylor and kind of building that conversation because those conversations are happening, but I think we could structure those in more productive ways.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:28:52:22],00:29:11:02,"Part of the process that you're involved in it, these great for bringing up conversations, you know, and making people sort of think about it more deliberately. So I think all of that's good. It's a fantastic educational facility. So it's expensive. You know, again, it's the nuts and bolts finances of like it needs finances to be able to make that work.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:29:11:04],00:29:37:13,"It's a really important place for students and not just in the sciences. And I think, you know, like throw in a little gendered piece of this, do the vast majority of the students who have landed there in the past few years, through my experiences it might that other field campus and Taylor's there women you know who are signing up for semester in the wild who are there with most program programing too.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:29:37:19],00:30:07:18,"So I think you know really thinking about really looking at the dynamics of Taylor, how it's being used, who's interested in it, making sure that we're creating these interdisciplinary holistic conversations on the instructor level and on the student level, really looking at those dynamics and making sure they're equitable and honoring who's in the room. I think that's really important.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:30:07:18],00:30:37:23,"It has to be part of the next step of Taylor for it to function in its best way. And I think Taylor had to be thinking about what I've kind of already said this, you know, climate change, if I were to name themes, right, change in general. But really climate change, I think that's an important conversation. Water connectivity, those things, building them out.",community
Teresa Cohn,[00:30:38:01],00:31:16:15,"I think it could be a very rich conversation. And what else do I want to say about what I think too should be? Having said all of that, Taylor always has and needs to continue to be careful about expansion, right? There's a carrying capacity for that place and there's real impact with airplanes flying in and out. So I know, you know, Jim and Holley and mules and thinking about what our footprint is there and what it ought to be.",aviation
Teresa Cohn,[00:31:16:15],00:31:43:05,"There is also a critical part of the conversation, and I know it's a part of the financial conversation, too, but we can't lose track of our impact on that place because we need the finances to be able to support the creative community. Right? I think there's a real delicate balance in all of that. And then the other thing is what you're doing right now, we need to we need to make sure we're telling the stories that exist there.",community;creativity
Teresa Cohn,[00:31:43:05],00:32:07:23,"I mean, Maurice, Gary, Jim, Holley like there's so many stories that need to be part of that community conversation. So I think building connectivity between the community that's there over time would be invaluable to the future of Taylor too. And that's part of the work that you're doing, which I think is really important. Yeah.",community
Jack Kredell,[00:32:08:01],00:32:13:14,And I think it would be important to bring in outsiders.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:32:13:15],00:32:31:09,"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that this is exactly right. It shouldn't be that insular. And, you know, I think there's a lot of push you vital like, you know, build scholars and get scholars in there to just I can see a million reasons that Taylor would be a site for scholars from all over the place. You know, students from all over the place, too.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:32:31:11],00:32:38:15,"I think you're exactly right. There's no need to be insular in me. In growing that creative community is really important as well. Yeah, exactly.",community;creativity;growth;
Jack Kredell,[00:32:38:17],00:32:41:18,Jim really likes the idea of an artist in residence.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:32:41:20],00:33:06:12,"What do you think of that? I love it. I love it. Yeah. Artist in residence, writers in residence, cartographers. And rather than it's Jack, you know, like be creative about and in some ways to the way that I think we might go about a conversation like that is okay what's the theme Don't talk about connectivity. Okay then what can bring Let's bring someone in who can inform us in a new way about how to think about this architecture.",community;creativity
Teresa Cohn,[00:33:06:12],00:33:21:08,"I don't know. You know, even putting people that you might not imagine would be there, You know, I think that's the kind of thing that generates dynamism, you know, to match the places.",creativity
Jack Kredell,[00:33:21:08],00:33:31:07,"So, yeah, I was just about to say that. Yeah, yeah, that's great. I think we got some good stuff. unless there's anything else.",
Unknown,[00:33:31:11],00:33:40:21,That you want to say that I'm probably unable to promised.,
Teresa Cohn,[00:33:40:23],00:33:41:23,With that.,
Jack Kredell,[00:33:42:01],00:33:43:18,Any beefs?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:33:43:20],00:33:44:20,Beefs about Taylor?,
Jack Kredell,[00:33:44:21],00:33:48:19,"No, no. I mean, like, if there's something you want to get off your chest.",
Teresa Cohn,[00:33:49:12],00:34:16:05,"no, everybody. I mean, is part of that place, too. It's like you care about it. You care about it deeply. If you care about it too much, maybe too much. But it's just like, yeah, everybody, sort of everybody who's attached. Taylor I guess there's some there's heartbreak involves, you know, and there's always a sort of like really everybody you talk to like a clash between like a cumbersome institution and wilderness, you know, like how the how do those things come together?",wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:34:16:05],00:34:30:07,"It's always going to be problems with how that works, you know, So so I think there's inevitable. yeah. Beef. Yeah, expensive. So that things.",
Jack Kredell,[00:34:30:09],00:34:36:21,Are actually very tightly woven together. Wilderness and large institution.,wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:34:36:23],00:34:53:13,"Yeah, you're right. Yeah, that's right. I mean, that's very true. That's very true. Yeah. And, you know, there's, there's the, like, the big wilderness capital W wilderness and little W wilderness, too. And maybe it's the little W wilderness that's different, you know, that sort of on its own terms a little bit more and that it's on some time frame.",wilderness
Teresa Cohn,[00:34:53:13],00:35:15:06,"It's, you know, sort of doing its own thing, Internet, you know, Internet back. There's I'm sure everybody, you know, you talk to would have a strong opinion about how that should be done better, where the TV should live, all of that kind of stuff that you're always going to have this really clash between those worlds. what was I going to say?",
Teresa Cohn,[00:35:15:08],00:35:56:03,"Anything else about Taylor? Just. Just know. Just like I a not relevant, but I dream about it at least three times a week. Yeah. You know, this is again, it's like the it's just there in all of its iterations, you know, it's kind of a place that I want to honor about Jim and Holly and sort of having spent the amount of time they did back there, just like where it lives in them and how it manifests and your dreams.",wonder
Teresa Cohn,[00:35:56:03],00:36:06:18,"Are you just there at. Taylor Yeah, all sorts of things happening, airplanes and yeah, it's like, yeah, okay, Yeah, all sorts of iterations. Yeah.",
Unknown,[00:36:06:20],00:36:11:07,Do you remember any specific dream?,
Teresa Cohn,[00:36:17:14],00:36:40:23,"I mean, I can remember a million things from, like, you know, or like the air. Not quite the same, but it's still an airstrip or. Yeah, yeah, not, I wouldn't say like, no, it sounds like all kinds of iterations. None of them like the real actuality, you know. But yeah. And so there's something that, there's something this sort of like, you know, permanently stays with you, at least for now.",aviation

Teresa Cohn,[00:36:48:21],00:37:20:02,"Maybe. Maybe, you know, Do you know what I see? Yeah. I'll have to go back to see. Yeah. Taylor sticks with you. I'm going to say something else to you about Taylor. You can talk to the pilots. I'd like to talk to them like Doris. Let me right there, and then I. I mean, want to. But they've seen so much, you know, from the air.",aviation
