Jennifer Ladino,[00:00:00:00],00:00:25:10,"My name is Jennifer Ladino and I'm a professor at the University of Idaho and the English Department. I'm also core faculty in environmental science, and I've been here since 2010, which is roughly when I started to get involved with the Taylor Wilderness Research Station through planning for the Semester in the Wild program, which we launched in 2013. And I was part of the interdisciplinary team that helped put that together.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:00:25:12],00:01:03:23,"So basically I learned about Taylor when I was at my new faculty orientation, and someone came and spoke about this magical place that was, you know, 35 miles in by foot or a 30 minute bus plane ride, and that we sometimes brought students into the space and researchers. And I was like, pick me. And so I went and introduced myself to Steve Holland Horse back then and got involved with the planning for for a semester in the wild to sort of ingratiate myself into that that planning phase and was really fortunate to be part of the initial cohort of people that taught in and learned this semester in the wild.",wonder
Jennifer Ladino,[00:01:04:01],00:01:12:19,So that is my early relationship with what is affectionately called the Taylor Ranch.,
Jack Kredell,[00:01:12:21],00:01:24:04,"Can you talk about Semester in the Wild, what it is, and what some of the goals are for the program?",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:01:24:06],00:01:47:12,"Yeah, Yeah. I mean, I think one of the early taglines we came up with was America's Wildest Classroom. Right. Like, this is a really unique place for students to spend time. And the two things that I think make it the most unique are one is in this giant wilderness area, the largest in the lower 48, the Frank Church River of No Return.",water;wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:01:47:14],00:02:16:03,"And then students get to spend the full semester there. And that's a really unique opportunity for them. There's nothing quite like it that I know of in the US. And the other thing is that we we deliberately designed it to be an interdisciplinary curriculum with a humanities presence. So it's not that they're just out there learning river ecology or wildlife biology, but that they're also writing and they're reading and they're thinking about the sort of human dimensions of this wilderness.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:02:16:03],00:02:34:01,"And we have that as a core piece of the curriculum from the start. And I think that makes it really unique as well. I can keep going. No, I mean, I'm trying to work on shorter interview answers. I'm a rambler in job interviews, but in this sort of thing.",
Jack Kredell,[00:02:34:03],00:02:41:10,"You know, not as much like imagined. Imagine somebody who doesn't know anything about the program.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:02:41:16],00:02:42:11,"Yeah, maybe.",
Jack Kredell,[00:02:42:11],00:02:47:08,"Even a dry Idaho student. Yeah. Like, this is all very good information.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:02:47:09],00:03:09:20,"Well, and they need to do a better job at telling their story because it is such a unique opportunity for students. They spend the fall semester there often will end, I think, right around Thanksgiving break because the weather gets too too bad to keep the buildings open. But students are there for a good three months and faculty rotate in and out and teach their courses in sort of a block format.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:03:09:22],00:03:35:14,"So that works really well. There's focused time for students to really deeply engage with the material for one course and really get to know one faculty member at a time. Sometimes we go in in teams and that works really well as as well. But yeah, we, we design in a lot of overlap between the courses and synergy. You know, we might read the same text but read it in the environmental history course as well as in the environmental writing course.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:03:35:15],00:04:06:13,"Right. So you're tackling it from both the historical perspective and the perspective of sort of close analysis of language. One of my favorite moments in the first couple of years was thinking closely about the language of the Wilderness Act. So the word untrammeled, for instance, is really a tricky one, and it's been the source of a lot of discussion and some controversy and sort of the legal world like what does it mean to say that this is an untrammeled space?",government
Jennifer Ladino,[00:04:06:15],00:04:31:14,"And so bringing your sort of literary studies, English major, English professor lands to bear on sort of the language of that legal document. It was really, really fascinating. And it was a great way to teach students sort of our bread and butter skill of close reading, you know, paying attention to the connotations and the richness of language and to think about what the Wilderness Act meant when it was made in 1964 and what it means, you know, 50 plus years later.",government
Jennifer Ladino,[00:04:31:14],00:04:39:15,"So that sort of synergy, I think, makes the program really fascinating and distinctive.",
Jack Kredell,[00:04:39:17],00:05:11:23,"Are there any tensions between this idea of wilderness as untrammeled space and trampled space? Taylor. Taylor as a human space, human environment that is ensconced within a much larger wilderness. Are there any tensions between those two things, or is it or is or are they productive tensions maybe?",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:05:12:01],00:05:35:11,"Yeah. I mean, the whole idea of wilderness is full of tensions, right? Even the word and trampled means we sort of think of it as meaning like untouched or inhibited. And that is kind of what it means. But what that also implies as a kind of free item, Right? So like a freedom to for wild horses to remain wild is part of it.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:05:35:13],00:06:05:08,"So that implies a very hands off participation in or lack of from humans. And so I think there's this tension between soaring wilderness as both a sort of that antithesis to civilization, something that is not us, but because we created it, because it was sort of our idea to sort of make wilderness a designated space. And it's always had, you know, the imprint of of human presence.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:06:05:08],00:06:25:00,"And so you can't fully separate out, you know, wilderness from civilization, especially in a place like Taylor, where you've got, you know, planes landing and you've got horses and you have hunters coming through. And there's plenty of activity that bears the mark of of humans. Right. And the humans live there most of the year. So that's one of the tensions.",aviation
Jennifer Ladino,[00:06:25:00],00:06:49:07,"I mean, the wilderness, there's so much so much to it. You know, historically, if you think back to just what it means and what it how it registers emotionally to people, right? Like in the 19th century, it was a scary thing, Like it was a terrifying place. The word wilderness had connotations of fear and, you know, awesomeness and that sense of of sublime sort of fascination and horror.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:06:49:09],00:07:11:21,"And it was something that because of that, you know, Western European colonists thought they needed to sort of tame. And you see some of that legacy and just the idea of sort of managing wilderness, right? We manage it and some National Park Service have spaces have managed wilderness that's maybe not been officially designated, but is sort of earmarked for that.",legacy
Jennifer Ladino,[00:07:11:21],00:07:37:03,"And so they manage it as such. So, you know, starting around the end of the 19th century and you can read environmental historians on this, but we've reached we European colonists reached the end of the mainland. US began to sort of have some anxiety about running out of sort of nature. Right. And feeling like the frontier was closed.",legacy
Jennifer Ladino,[00:07:37:03],00:08:08:11,"You have the famous frontier thesis in 1890. And so the the emotional tenor of what wilderness meant sort of flipped, I think, at that point. And it became this this special place that we needed to actually not tame and sort of control, but like take care of and preserve. And it started to take on these this very different definition of wilderness as not only antithetical to sort of civilization, but a kind of cure or a place to go and recover from, you know, excessive civilization.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:08:08:13],00:08:33:12,"And what someone like Theodore Roosevelt might call the sort of softness of over civilization that was, you know, demasculating the American population. So, yeah, the tensions are really they're historical, they're legal, and they're, I think, emotional in certain ways. I could say more about that, Right. That piece, maybe.",
Jack Kredell,[00:08:33:14],00:08:34:16,There's a lot there.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:08:34:18],00:08:37:22,I yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:08:38:00],00:08:49:12,One thing that is in keeping with wilderness doctrine about Taylor is is that with the exception of sort of the caretaker or caretaker or the station manager.,government;wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:08:49:15],00:08:50:07,Yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:08:50:09],00:08:57:21,"It, it is a place of visitations. Yeah. and numerous comings and goings.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:08:58:02],00:08:59:06,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
Jack Kredell,[00:08:59:10],00:09:15:06,"And I'm wondering as, as a visitor yourself. Yeah. What, what do you take away from Taylor when you leave or it's like when you get back home or what stays with you or what have you been.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:09:15:08],00:09:42:01,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's almost like a cleanse, like a mind body cleanse, right? Like you, you get out there and I haven't walked in, which I think would be a different kind of entryway or gateway into the Taylor sort of wilderness space. But when you come in by plane and it's it's loud in those small planes and it's a little unsteady and you're, you know, looking out over this vast expanse of just like mountain range after mountain range.",aviation
Jennifer Ladino,[00:09:42:01],00:10:06:18,"And it's stunning to fly in and see that there's just the bigness of it, but it's still quite loud. And you're in this contraption in this machine and you land on what appears to be a, you know, very dangerous airstrip that's made of grass and not very long. And the plane lands and the engine turns off and the propeller stops and suddenly it's just completely quiet and still.",aviation
Jennifer Ladino,[00:10:06:19],00:10:25:02,"Right. Maybe you hear Big Creek, maybe sort of gurgling off to the side. Maybe someone greets you. See, there's a human there. Probably someone will greet you, the manager. Or if you're teaching in semester in the wild, it could be the faculty member that you're going to high five in tag team out of. There could be the students who are waiting to meet you for the first time or give you a hug if you're meeting them for the second time.",community
Jennifer Ladino,[00:10:25:06],00:10:54:13,"So there is always a human element, but like it gets slow and quiet from the very beginning. And so from that point on, it feels like you just kind of sad layers in a way, and you you fluff off, you know, the veil, like continuous partial attention, right. That most of us live in in the world. You know, you've got people checking their phones and scrolling and that doesn't happen there.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:10:54:13],00:11:30:00,"There's no cell signal. They do have wi fi that seems to be getting better. And better every year. And you can, you know, check in as needed. But it's not constant. It's not continuous. So there's that's one layer that I think you kind of shed right away. And it just feels like you pare things down to the essentials and you kind of recalibrate your priorities a little bit, which is, again, a kind of mind body cleanse where you think and feel like what's important, what's kind of elemental or bedrock in your in your life.",perspective
Jennifer Ladino,[00:11:30:00],00:11:55:13,"And there's something kind of magic about the place that I don't know how that could not happen to you. Right. And I've seen it happen with every single student that has done this Semester in the Wild program and the faculty as well. So then, you know, I can talk more about what it's like to be there. But when you go back to, you know, quote unquote, civilization, it can be a little shocking at first, especially for students who have spent several months and not left at all.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:11:55:15],00:12:16:05,"They find it pretty overwhelming. And it's almost like a reentry. We've actually worked with international programs, officers to talk about like reentry tips for going from one culture or one foreign country to another to your home country, and having it be really different when you return and not always in good ways. So, you know, it feels really loud.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:12:16:05],00:12:36:10,"It feels really busy. The grocery store has so much to offer and you don't know where to start. So things like that, I think, hit students really hard. For me as faculty, it's like, my inbox has thousands of emails in it that I didn't, you know, I let slide because I was, you know, embracing the experience of being there.",perspective
Jennifer Ladino,[00:12:36:12],00:13:12:12,"And yet somehow there's like a calmness that I think, at least for me really sticks with you. Having spent a week or ten days in a wilderness, it's that quietness that sticks with you. It lingers.",perspective
Jack Kredell,[00:13:12:14],00:13:14:23,I want to know what with that.,
Unknown,[00:13:15:04],00:13:20:17,"Sad state of feeling elemental, mean for.",
Jack Kredell,[00:13:20:17],00:13:29:12,"You personally. It's like, what? What? What is elemental.",
Unknown,[00:13:29:14],00:13:33:19,For you when you get to Taylor?,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:13:33:21],00:14:09:09,"That's a hard question. I hadn't thought or used the word elemental until today, so I have to think about this a little bit. I mean, I mean, you think about just the elements, right? Like there's water and you can constantly hear Big Creek, There's fresh air. It smells nice. It feels very clean. That's not I mean, unless you're there during a smoky time, which I haven't been, but that would be really different, a different element, I guess fire would be involved in that case.",wildfire
Jennifer Ladino,[00:14:09:09],00:14:41:01,"But you see the residue of of fire. The history of fire on the landscape when you're flying over and in certain parts of the wilderness. What's the other element went, yeah, gosh, plenty of wind. The plane, you know, you feel you're riding in on an air and that's pretty amazing slash scary. But I think what I mean is more like you become cognizant of your animality, right?",wildfire
Jennifer Ladino,[00:14:41:02],00:15:03:21,"Like your basic ness, your fleshy, embodied nature, Like we are wild animals. And when you're living in close quarters with other wild animals, right, you can see bears coming. The bears will come into the Taylor complex and, you know, eat apples, for example. You know that there are cougars. Even if you don't see them, you might hear wolves.",perspective
Jennifer Ladino,[00:15:03:21],00:15:28:19,"You can see bighorn sheep up on the benches just walking up straight up from the the research station, smaller examples would be like aphids that would interrupt our classrooms, our classrooms, are outdoor classrooms, which might consist of, you know, walking up to a ridge and sitting or there's one sort of outdoor classroom that was a set of tree stumps where you just sit in a circle and sit on the airstrip.",perspective
Jennifer Ladino,[00:15:28:19],00:16:00:03,"That was actually out near the airstrip where the planes land. And so I think being reminded that you co inhabit this place with other wild creatures is elemental in the sense that it reminds you of your basic animal nature. So that's kind of what I mean. And then to go back to the like sloughing off layers, thinking, I mean, every student that I saw and myself included, you know, you don't you don't sort of put yourself together in the same way.",aviation
Jennifer Ladino,[00:16:00:03],00:16:23:14,"There as you might in a professional setting on a campus. Women stopped wearing makeup. They didn't save their legs. They might not use deodorant, they might not shower as much. There's there was a kind of naturalization process, I guess, for all of us that makes you feel more at home for in the place and maybe in your your body and who you are.",routine
Jennifer Ladino,[00:16:23:14],00:16:45:07,"I had some really interesting conversations with the young women about about this. Well, why do I shave my legs normally? Like as is this something that is important to me to do, you know? And it makes it it's like a kind of banal example of rethinking someone's priorities. Right? And it's like, what matters to me and where did I get that idea that that's something I should do, you know, back in reality.",routine
Jennifer Ladino,[00:16:45:09],00:17:07:01,"So, yeah, elemental, basic, fundamental, natural. I mean, natural is another loaded word that, you know, we can talk more about. But, you know, we are natural, we are a wilderness is our birth place to kind of piggyback on one of my collaborators at Columbia and semester in the while, that was what he would sort of preach. And he was almost like a preacher to these students.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:17:07:01],00:17:28:16,"They loved his classes because he would just talk and talk and talk about wilderness and history and what does it mean to us? And he would talk about it as our home. It's our sort of primary home. So when you come into a wilderness area, it's like coming home. And that really resonated with with me and a lot of the students. Mosquitoes, for example...",wilderness
Jack Kredell,[00:17:28:18],00:17:38:23,"There I, I like this shot. It has a lot of there's a lot of shadow.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:17:39:01],00:17:40:21,Yeah I can see the sun.,
Jack Kredell,[00:17:41:03],00:17:41:10,As it.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:17:41:15],00:17:42:13,Moved now.,
Jack Kredell,[00:17:42:19],00:17:46:01,So it's interesting Some people hate it. I've always liked.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:17:46:01],00:17:52:23,"It. Yeah, it's sparkly. Yeah, I don't mind it as long as I look good. It's all the matter.",
Jack Kredell,[00:17:55:19],00:18:16:19,"as a, as a scholar of emotion and aspect, actually, no, it has. Yeah. No. Yeah. As a scholar of human emotion and exercise.",
Unknown,[00:18:17:01],00:18:33:14,"But, it's just as a scholar and keen observer of emotion and aspect.",
Jack Kredell,[00:18:33:16],00:18:42:14,"What what kinds of aspects do you see in students when they, when they arrive at Taylor.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:18:42:16],00:19:06:05,"Yeah, there's, I mean this is going to sound cliche, but the first thing that comes to mind is this kind of childlike joy. Like, they're just so happy, you know, at least at times. I mean, there are times, of course, when like with any foreign travel, you know, they have that curve right, where you're like, you're high and then you kind of go through a low point and then you come back out of it at the end of your journey.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:19:06:07],00:19:27:07,"Sometimes there's a little bit of that and the ups and downs. But I think these there are moments of sort of pure innocence, just like joy with again, this comes back to that like unmasking or sloughing off of pretensions and and these are the layers that we sort of use to put our identities together and this kind of uninhibitedness.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:19:27:08],00:19:47:18,"Maybe this comes back to being untrammeled, right? Like, it's not just the wilderness, it's untrammeled, it's the the people that go there and they somehow are free in that same kind of way, uninhibited. But yeah, there's a joyfulness, a playfulness. A lot of students, you know, they made up games, they wrote songs together. There were, you know, when they cooked meals, they were goofy.",routine
Jennifer Ladino,[00:19:47:19],00:20:28:10,"It was, you know, just fun. They were just having fun, you know, in a way that was not like unpretentious, no judgment. And that's why I say childlike, I guess, is just kind of. Yeah, just pure, pure joy in moments. I mean, they I asked them about emotions. It's been a while since I've thought about this. I'd have to look back at some of their essays and things, but just that the curiosity of learning a new place of planning and mapping out and packing for a backpacking trip, for example, that kind of curious inquiry.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:20:28:10],00:20:51:06,"And I do think curiosity is a kind of emotion. You could call it an affect, but in this case I feel like it is a joyful embrace of newness and a kind of wonder, I guess would be another one. I'm kind of wanting to know more, which is kind of what the noun form of wonder or what the verb form of wonder, I guess is, is to wonder about something, right?",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:20:51:08],00:21:13:04,"If the noun form is an emotion, you feel a sense of wonder, then the verb form is like wanting to know more about that. And I think you see a lot of both of those things among students and faculty in Semester in the Wild, a sense of wanting to learn about this place too, and learning being both an intellectual process, right, and an emotional one.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:21:13:04],00:22:04:17,"I think there's a kind of embodied knowledge that is both intellectual and kind of affective or emotional that that we all embrace there. That is how learning should happen, in my opinion. And Kayla's other emotions. I mean, certainly I had students write about encounters with other animals and there were some really fun moments. And again, it's maybe a little fear and ah, at first, but I want to come back to wonder, because to me, Wonder is a kind of less intense, more manageable form of where you're not maybe in that fight or flight or freeze feeling, but you're feeling a sense of curiosity and exploration.",wonder
Jennifer Ladino,[00:22:04:19],00:22:25:03,"And maybe I'm sure students felt both. If it was a rattlesnake encounter, for example, there's a lot of rattlesnakes out there in the heat of the summer, which I was never, never there for that part. I always went later in the fall or encountering a bear or another large predator. Certainly could be a little bit of both. But yeah, lots of lots of wonder.",wonder
Jennifer Ladino,[00:22:26:21],00:22:50:19,"and I, yeah, I think a lot of it is with non-human animals. But you had students who were fascinated by plants who would sit for hours and study and draw, which we did a lot of sketching and that sort of journaling. So that's a fascination too, that I think is pretty unique to that learning experience and that that environment, you could do that in a traditional campus classroom.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:22:50:19],00:23:19:05,"You know, you could go to the arboretum and sit, but most classes are pretty tightly constrained in terms of time, whereas semester in the wild, you feel like you have all the time in the world. It really is. We called it tailor time and time is really slow there and it just seems like there's so many hours in the day and the days are long and we try to keep class time fairly compressed so that students have, you know, the opportunity to explore and learn at their leisure.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:23:19:07],00:23:43:18,"I know some students would probably bristle at what I'm saying because often they felt the same stresses and pressures to get work done that that students feel on campus. And we do work them pretty hard. There's a rigorous learning curriculum that they have to have to do, but I think, you know, they learn skills really fast, like much faster than students who have all the distractions of a traditional campus.",perspective
Jennifer Ladino,[00:23:43:23],00:24:04:07,"Like they could get close reading in a session and like, go out and practice it and come back and teach it to me the next day and teach it to each other. Whereas on campus we spend, you know, the semester kind of doing close reading bootcamp and like doing that, doing drills basically, and kind of learning the skill over and over again.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:24:04:09],00:24:27:17,"So they need a little less, a little less reinforcement. It's things click quickly there. In my experience, which I attribute to the the kind of purity of the lack of distractions, primarily I forgot where the start I feel like.",
Jack Kredell,[00:24:27:19],00:24:30:10,So it's a good discipline area.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:24:30:12],00:24:35:21,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Strong disciplinarian. Yeah. Yeah.",
Jack Kredell,[00:24:35:23],00:24:41:09,Have you had any memorable animal encounters?,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:24:41:11],00:24:49:07,"Not there. No, not that I can talk about it. Taylor.",
Jack Kredell,[00:24:49:09],00:25:14:08,"Yeah. The idea of wilderness as a home is very interesting to me because I, I personally don't feel that way. Yeah, And for, for many of us, it is not a home, but it is. It is a home for for wild animals.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:25:14:09],00:25:15:06,Yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:25:17:04],00:25:31:13,"and I wonder if you or your students have, have felt the need to acclimatize to this home that animals spend all of their time in. And you. Very little.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:25:31:15],00:25:32:19,Yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:25:32:21],00:25:38:08,And if that's part of this rehoming process for sure.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:25:38:14],00:26:08:16,"I mean, I think in the early years of the program when students hiked in, they had a much easier time adapting to life there. Some students have never backpacked, for example, never carried a backpack. And so having that opportunity to carry some of their stuff and obviously not all of it, and to kind of meander their way to, you know, to the heart of the wilderness was a much different and easier way to acclimatize.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:26:08:18],00:26:33:18,"And sure, I mean, to depending on people's experience levels and what they expected coming into this program, some were more immediately at home than others. It might take some time. Yeah. I mean, in some people, you know, anxiety, I'm sure about like the openness, you know, it's almost a kind of agoraphobia to feel like you're so remote and it's so open and help as far away.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:26:33:19],00:26:54:15,"Like that's part of that's one definition of agoraphobia. It's like feeling like you're so in such a remote, open space that you're on your own and you kind of are like, there are days when the planes can't fly because the weather is too bad and you just hope you don't break something or get really sick during one of those weather periods.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:26:54:17],00:27:24:00,"So it's yeah, I think that's part of the excitement for some people is that you, you know, part of being in a wilderness area is accepting a little bit of risk. That's part of the maybe adventure that some recreational is look for. You know, the more thrill seeking folks the campus itself, the Taylor Wilderness research Station itself feels very comfortable to some students, to comfortable like they wanted it to be rougher, like they didn't want to stay in a nice cabin.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:27:24:02],00:27:49:08,"Right. And so after the first few years, with the help of the DeVlieg Foundation, we were able to put together some wall tents. So now the students live in wall tents, which they share with two or three other students. And so those are much more humble. You know, they do have ways of heating. I think they've got a little wood stoves in there where they can heat it when it gets really cold, but they're nice.",community
Jennifer Ladino,[00:27:49:09],00:28:10:11,"So you can hear the creak still that you feel a little bit more like you're not in a house. So that's I guess that's a different way of thinking about home, isn't it? Like feeling a level of comfort and at home in a in a building. So if you take the building away, then you're sort of a little bit more at home in the wilderness, you can say.",community
Jennifer Ladino,[00:28:10:13],00:28:34:10,"But I think for me, I had spent a lot of years as a park ranger and it felt very familiar to be on a small piece of land with very old buildings and a community of workers and learners that you sort of are sharing a mission with. To me, that was what I did for 13 summers with the National Park Service.",community
Jennifer Ladino,[00:28:34:10],00:29:02:11,"And so I wasn't disoriented or ill at ease upon entering. But yeah, it would be different for for different people, for sure. It's I mean, the word this reminds me a little bit of the word bewilder or bewilderment, which is all about feeling lost or disoriented and it comes from the verb wilder, which used to mean to like, lead somebody astray or to like, be led astray.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:29:02:13],00:29:24:01,"So that's really interesting to think about how wilderness can be disorienting, unsettling, confounding kind of experience. And I think some students wish it was more like that, like they needed a little more of that risk. And then for others, it was it was a lot all at once. Yeah.",wilderness
Jack Kredell,[00:29:24:03],00:29:32:20,"Yeah. I mean, you can implying that that's a vital part of Taylor's educational platform and environment.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:29:32:22],00:29:54:08,"Yeah, it is. Absolutely. And I think flexibility, you know, it's one of those areas where, like I was saying, with planes and weather systems, there is a lot of uncertainty even now, even as as civilized as we've made it and safe as we've made it. Of course, safety is a huge priority for the program. It still has elements of the unknown, the unexpected.",routine
Jennifer Ladino,[00:29:54:09],00:30:22:09,"You might have to shift gears partway through a lesson if you know a rainstorm comes. Once we had a students stop class because it was raining outside and she wanted to just listen to that for a while and and like be present with the storm. So we stopped class and did that. I think it forces you to have a kind of flexible teaching style, which always was my preferred mode anyway, but even more so in a wilderness area.",routine
Jennifer Ladino,[00:30:22:11],00:30:47:07,"So yeah, uncertainty, flexibility, a little bit of confounding. Yes, I guess. And if you're out, you know, on a trail or off a trail and sort of exploring, there's plenty of opportunity for that sort of thing. Just right off the right off the campus. We got Pioneer Creek, for example. My colleague Scott Slovic has a great essay about getting that lost, but going on a very epic hike with a student at Pioneer Creek.",water
Jennifer Ladino,[00:30:47:07],00:30:57:05,"So you should ask him about that. He wrote about it in this book that I'm holding.Yes, Idaho Wilderness Considered. You should pick it up. It's great book. 2016.",
Jack Kredell,[00:30:57:06],00:30:58:22,Yeah I know.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:30:59:00],00:31:00:02,I think it's 2016.,
Jack Kredell,[00:31:00:07],00:31:04:14,Who has doing work on Pioneer Creek?,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:31:04:21],00:31:05:06,"no, wait.",
Jack Kredell,[00:31:05:10],00:31:08:05,"Grace. Pervan. Yeah, so. okay.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:31:08:09],00:31:09:10,"Yeah, yeah.",
Jack Kredell,[00:31:09:12],00:31:11:08,Yeah. She works with Marise.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:31:11:10],00:31:12:07,Okay.,
Jack Kredell,[00:31:12:09],00:31:15:04,That's very interesting.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:31:15:06],00:31:44:13,"Yeah, Yeah. Getting lost as, as part of it, I think. And I didn't go on any of the backpacking trips with the students I really wish I had. But you can ask Scott or Adam about that, that experience, you know, and I don't think there were any major losses, although other things exciting things happened. But yeah, yeah. You feel you feel pretty out there.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:31:44:13],00:32:12:03,"I mean, you are out there, you're far from health services, for example, far from roads. So to me that's a nice feeling. But I think for other people it may not be so nice. And I mean, one of the things people value about wilderness traditionally is just knowing that it's there, whether you can personally go to it or want to go to it or not.",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:32:12:05],00:32:23:23,"It's an idea. It's a it's a material thing, but it's also an idea. And people like to know that we have wilderness that is there, you know, that means something.",
Jack Kredell,[00:32:24:01],00:32:27:19,"To have the option of discomfort, even if you take it.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:32:28:01],00:32:33:18,"Yeah, yeah. Knowing that other people are climbing Mount Everest and you don't have to like. Yeah.",
Jack Kredell,[00:32:33:20],00:32:49:15,"Yeah, yeah. I want to work with you far too because I, I want to do it. These are on, on wilderness with you.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:32:49:17],00:32:53:15,Yeah. I would need to probably prep a bit for that. I No.,
Jack Kredell,[00:32:53:15],00:33:30:17,"No. Europe or No, my, my wheels are spinning but I want to, I want to. Let's just end with, given the value that you outlined for retailers educational prices, what, what you, what would you like to see for Taylor's future?",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:33:30:19],00:33:57:21,"That's a great question. I mean, the semester in the wild program could grow. We've we've never maxed out the number of students that could benefit from it. So one quick answer is just better recruiting. You know, honestly, for that program, I think we could we could do more to get the word out, to tell the story about how unique Semester in the Wild is as a program.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:33:58:01],00:34:21:11,"We don't want it to get too big. I mean, for me as an educator, like right around a dozen is pretty optimal. But I think we can hold upwards even close to 20. I'm pretty sure I'd have to check that as always, a fine line, right? Because you don't want to argue that we need to get more people into the wilderness because then, you know, at what point does it become overpopulated or does it lose some of that magic character?",wilderness
Jennifer Ladino,[00:34:21:13],00:34:43:17,"But I would love to see more researchers and scholars from all of the disciplines be invited and have opportunities to use that space. Right? We've got the writing in the wild fellowship that our creative writing students get to take advantage of it as an application process. Three of them go every fall, late summer or early fall, and that's cool.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:34:43:17],00:35:13:06,"So more opportunities like that for for faculty. I'd love to see it be a place for percolating sort of interdisciplinary collaboration. For example, beyond the Semester in the Wild program, you know, there are faculty doing really interesting work on campus that, you know, if we did retreats there, I think, you know, we could make even more progress together in these concentrated bursts of time that are so rare and valuable for for faculty researchers.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:35:13:08],00:35:41:11,"You know, I don't know how I feel about sort of opening up to broader publics beyond the university, but yeah, I'd have to think about that. But it is such a unique and special place, so I part of you really wants to share it with, with more people, you know, get people out there, but without crossing that line of changing it.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:35:41:13],00:36:00:18,"But that's a conversation for another time. The tension between change and stasis, that's very much a part of what wilderness is, especially with climate change and impacts of that. I think that's a great note to end on, but.",wilderness
Jack Kredell,[00:36:00:20],00:36:11:09,"I like to have this. I should have warned you, I, I like to have awkward pauses at the ends of ideas. Yeah, I could, I could end videos there.",creativity
Jennifer Ladino,[00:36:11:20],00:36:12:04,yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:36:12:04],00:36:13:08,And you like to fill them up.,
Jennifer Ladino,[00:36:13:08],00:36:20:00,I know. Sorry I sort of I've been. I've been doing really well. I thought I normally I do a lot more filling.,
Jack Kredell,[00:36:20:08],00:36:25:02,"that was, We, we have almost 40 minutes right there.",
Jennifer Ladino,[00:36:25:09],00:36:25:20,great.,
