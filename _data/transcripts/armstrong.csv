Andrew Armstrong,[00:00:00:00],00:00:37:11,"My name is Andrew Armstrong. I am the facility superintendent out here. I recently graduated from college with a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering. And I was thinking, you know, what am I going to do that is going to combine being outdoors in the wilderness and ranching, which I love, and also kind of this interest in science, which I kind of developed from my time working on my Ph.D. and, you know, I basically saw this job pop up at Taylor Ranch, and it wasn't really what I was intending to do.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:00:37:13],00:00:59:08,"But, you know, in life you just take these opportunities and jump on it and see what happens. And that's kind of why I'm out here. I grew up and my family, had a back end to trail building, construction business, and one of the projects we rebuilt, Cabin Creek Airstrip, which is the airstrip about five miles upstream from here.",aviation
Andrew Armstrong,[00:00:59:10],00:01:29:12,"That was in 1999. And back in those days, the caretakers where Jim Ackerson and we would come down here and see this little Shangri-La of just a beautiful ranch out here and come see Jim and Holly, who work with ... in this traditional way. And we're really kind of a inspirational figure in my life. And I saw this job come about, and here I am.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:01:29:14],00:01:36:02,"Hey, Blackie.",
Jack Kredell,[00:01:36:04],00:01:46:06,Can you talk about what your daily life here is like? What the daily operation of Taylor Ranch is like?,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:01:46:08],00:02:10:05,"Well, the life out here depends a lot on the seasons. You know, It's not like you do something new or you kind of doing something new, just depending on what needs to be done. So, you know, in the fall, you know, you might be on a restart.",
Jack Kredell,[00:02:10:05],00:02:24:14,That one or all of the state. What Yeah. What is the daily operation of the ranch look like?,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:02:24:16],00:03:00:18,"Just the daily operation of Taylor just kind of depends on the seasons like today was the day with a bunch of people and you know, part of it is just accommodating people and making sure everyone's happy, keeping people busy, working on people's projects, making sure that kind of the progress is forward. You know, so recently I was doing a bunch of hands that I was, you know, had to get all the equipment up and running and do a bunch of maintenance and kind of figure out how it all work.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:03:00:18],00:03:28:09,"Because it's my first year back here and my dad came in and helped me out with figuring out how all this horse drawn equipment works. Currently we're using instructions, pull it. But so I was recently, you know, just using a pitchfork and tossing a bunch of hay in the hay wagon and then taking it to the barn. And I kind of had to rethink how to fix the barn because the barn has been out of commission for a bit.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:03:28:09],00:04:00:03,"So I've been working on that these days. It's still easier. There's a lot of irrigation, so moving sprinklers around, kind of redoing the irrigation, keeping the airstrip mowed, kind of working with the stock, kind of doing getting the electric fences all ready to kind of keep them corralled. You know, it just kind of depends on the day I wake up and I think I'm going to do something and I end up doing kind of something else.",aviation;water
Andrew Armstrong,[00:04:00:03],00:04:25:23,"And it's kind of how it is for most of the year. And, you know, in the winter, you know, you're kind of getting the pipes all ready for the freeze up in the middle of the winter. You're going up there and you're clearing the intakes and making sure the water keeps running and you're going out and checking for the wildlife activity, because just in the middle of winter, it's just it's kind of crazy back here.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:04:25:23],00:04:57:13,"The amount of mountain lions and wolves and deer, it's you know, it's kind of a cold, hungry canyon. So in the middle of winter, it's kind of what we're doing in the spring, kind of getting the garden going. We did a lot of fuels reduction, so it is and prescribed burns out here. And then, you know, at some point everything opens up enough that we can start having students and groups back here middle of spring, and then we run internships.",wolves;wildfire
Andrew Armstrong,[00:04:57:15],00:05:27:19,"That's kind of early summer and we run that until kind of the fire season starts, which is about now. And I'm kind of getting all the irrigation prepped for fire season and, you know, then we'll have semester in the wild and I haven't done that yet, so I'm intrigued to see how that all goes.",wildfire;water
Jack Kredell,[00:05:27:20],00:05:38:11,What do you talk about the animals currently at Taylor.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:05:38:12],00:06:09:05,"Yeah, so when I first got the job here, I figured I had a dog and I had a cat, but I heard there were a lot of packrats. So I went down to the MC Paws Animal Shelter here in McCall, and I heard they're in McCall and I got a couple of kittens, and I've been here about one year and here is this guy.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:06:09:07],00:06:31:04,"He's a good one. So I got I have three cats. and they all do a good job of dealing with the mice. You know, you can either have lots of mouse traps or you can have cats. So I chose to have cats. There were a lot of pack rats, and I have a dog. Josey She's not here at the moment.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:06:31:04],00:07:04:14,"She's out at the vet, but she does a lot of work in kind of dealing with the pack rat. She also does a good job of establishing the relationship between us and like all the predators that are coming in here and kind of like letting them know that, you know, this is our place. And then we've got some chickens, got five chickens, which is great for me and several other people.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:07:04:14],00:07:32:06,"But, you know, if you have big groups, there's not quite as many eggs. right now I've got a huge hummingbirds getting in on the action of my hummingbird feeder. I realize that I'm kind of worried that if I stop feeding, then they might just all die off because I think have established a large population simply on sugar water.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:07:32:08],00:08:00:18,"And recently we rode in a horse and a mule. And so I'm kind of starting off a journey of learning how to use pack animals in the wilderness. And that's partly why I came out here, is to kind of get that experience. So that's kind of the domestic animals that are out here. You know, we have a lot of sheep coming down, especially in the winter.",wilderness
Andrew Armstrong,[00:08:00:20],00:08:34:14,"The come down mostly across the across the canyon. There's a they have a wintering ground up in horse mountain and they come down here and use the legs. They can have a pretty periodic, you know, well time schedule where they can they come down to these kind of this here and then they go on up to a salt lake up high and they can just kind of have their out mountain lions.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:08:34:16],00:08:58:02,"They're probably all around all year long. But you can really you can be confident that they're around in the winter when you can see their tracks come through. Sometimes they'll slink right, right up through, you know, right through here and be real close to the cabin. And I'm always concerned about my cats. And I think that's for very justified reasons.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:09:00:15],00:09:25:13,"right now the bears are starting to come in a bunch. Here's just bear, you know, droppings all over, all over right now. And there you know, it's been a really good bury season. We had a long, long wet spring and they got a lot of currants and gooseberries because of that. So the bears are they just seem real happy right now.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:09:25:14],00:10:03:05,"And yeah, I mean right about now is they're having a herd of deer on the property probably like 20 with a resident buck in. It was Buck last year. That was the guy. And we'll just see who it is this year. And there's a real plethora of grouse on the strip and they kind of have been doing their little turkey dance where they get their tail feathers all up in a fan and they get their throats all bleeding and yeah, it's a good time of the year right now, but.",
Jack Kredell,[00:10:03:07],00:10:06:21,Also this year.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:10:06:23],00:10:13:21,So the question was just talk about the history of start with the chair.,
Jack Kredell,[00:10:13:23],00:10:18:01,"Yeah, who are you sitting in?",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:10:18:03],00:10:49:05,"Yeah, so this is Dave Lewis's chair. I don't know a whole lot of history of it, but Dave Lewis. Sorry. Going back this is just Taylor's chair and he made it. I don't know exactly when he made it. It's a really good chair. when I first got here, I noticed that it. It actually had a broken rocker.",legacy
Andrew Armstrong,[00:10:51:12],00:11:22:05,and so I ended up fixing it with some aluminum from an old plane. Just Taylor was kind of like he was a big game outfitter. He was kind of the one of the top. He was probably the top Bitcoin chief outfitter. Maybe not because he was so good. Just because the bitcoin sheep here is just huge. And also there were huge amount of them at that time.,aviation
Andrew Armstrong,[00:11:24:14],00:11:44:20,"but he, he, he ended up rebuilding the strip to make it longer, because it was pretty short at the time, but before he had rebuilt it, the main strip that he would use to resupply Taylor Ranch was Soldier Bar.",
Jack Kredell,[00:11:44:22],00:11:52:04,"And that's, that's going to be too long. No, no to",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:11:52:10],00:11:52:22,yeah.,
Jack Kredell,[00:11:52:23],00:12:00:21,"No. In this context, let's go with the chair, you know? Okay. Yeah. Let's go back to the beginning.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:03:04],00:12:05:21,Starting with the Native Americans.,
Jack Kredell,[00:12:06:14],00:12:09:09,you don't have to go back that far. There are other people who talk about that.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:09:15],00:12:13:11,"Yeah, I feel like I'd be much better at that. And various people.",
Jack Kredell,[00:12:13:13],00:12:15:17,"Just,",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:15:19],00:12:19:06,I would just. Just Taylor.,
Jack Kredell,[00:12:19:08],00:12:20:04,For Jade.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:20:05],00:12:23:17,They lost. yeah. She voters.,
Jack Kredell,[00:12:23:19],00:12:26:17,She'd be her campaign debut was at the packer.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:28:12],00:12:36:20,"for. Well, I'll just start with the Native Americans. You can, like, you can go as or as far you edit out as will show up.",
Jack Kredell,[00:12:36:22],00:12:43:01,So can you talk about the history of Taylor Ranch.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:12:43:03],00:13:23:02,"Yeah. So, I guess this place has been inhabited for eons by the Sheepeater band of Shoshone Native Americans. And, you know, they were probably, you know, we will never understand the land as they as they understood it. You know, their ability to hunt and, you know, kind of live with the migration patterns of animals and the salmon, you know, is not something that probably will ever I mean, I don't think we'll ever be able to kind of get to that level of understanding.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:13:23:04],00:14:01:19,"And they were mostly peaceful people. There was, however, a basically some Chinese miners who were murdered on the middle fork and the murder was claimed to be done by sheep or Band of Schoen. And the US Cavalry started in a campaign of, you know, basically exterminating them and moving them and so they basically came down Big Creek and ran into some sheep resistance.",indigenous
Andrew Armstrong,[00:14:01:19],00:14:53:04,"They I think there is only a few Sheepeater warriors and they, anyway, they ended up like basically missing the cavalry and forcing them up into the Vinegar Hills and, setting fire. And anyways, it was kind of a, it was a bit of a defeat for the cavalry and, but ultimately, you know, there was this campaign to deal with this beta band and, but one of the Packers that were resupplying the campaign was his name was Dave Lewis, and he had lived in Slate Creek, which is just down below Gainesville on the main salmon.",indigenous
Andrew Armstrong,[00:14:53:06],00:15:25:00,"And, he kind of just realized it was really a beautiful spot and he came back here to this live and he originally just had one cabin up there. There was, there was this lodge and he built his home and, it's pretty bad. Anyways, Dave Lewis lived here. He was this, he just lived until he was like 90 or something.",legacy
Andrew Armstrong,[00:15:25:00],00:15:43:03,"Here he was. This was real outdoorsman. he was an out. He was, he basically had. No, I'm just kidding.",
Jack Kredell,[00:15:43:05],00:15:58:16,"Don't to do this, I kind of like listening to you talk, and I kind of want to know, what your favorite thing about managing Taylor is.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:16:17:05],00:16:41:13,"You know, I, I, I just love the adventure, You know, like, in the middle of winter, it's. It's just me, and I, you know, I can go out and get on my skis and get on the big creek trail and kind of like, skip the cabin Creek and, and stuff and kind of hang out with all the wolves and, you know, you just tell your truth.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:16:41:13],00:17:17:10,"I'm like going up there. It's like this cold heart, cold, dark, hungry canyon. You know, there's only about, you know, late December, there's about one hour of sunlight that hits Taylor Ranch. And so it's and Taylor Ranch gets the most sun of anywhere in lower big creeks. So it's just there's no sun and all the you know, you're going along and all these predators, you know that you know that up there, all these predators are like looking down on you and they're watching you and you're skiing along with your dog kind of explorer and seeing what they're up to.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:17:17:10],00:17:42:06,"You know, you get on some wolf kill and you're you know, you just glad you're not a deer. But, I think that, you know, that's what I love is exploration. You know, there's so much to explore. And, you know, part of the reason I got some stock in here is just to help export. There's only so much you can do on your feet, in my impression.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:17:42:06],00:18:13:18,"I mean, especially if you're like a manager and you have to, like, come back every once in a while and. And also everything. I mean, everything from here is uphill and it's really steep. And so it's just like super hard to get to. But, you know, just going out, you kind of have this appreciation of of place. And I think that's pretty much what I like about being out here.",
Jack Kredell,[00:18:13:20],00:18:39:02,If you had any memorable animal encounters or experiences that that stand out to you from your time or to.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:18:39:04],00:19:01:20,"I think I think just kind of one of the I don't I don't really know exactly. I mean, I think that here one of the most special thing is seeing all the sheep. You know, they come down. They don't really seem to care too much about you.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:19:07:05],00:19:30:02,"Just kind of living in a place where there's, like, sheep coming on your property is pretty cool. And, but also the other thing I think is really cool is like the wolves, you know, you'll, there's a, there's a trail that goes up and it's goes up to these benches up there and, you know, the wolves will just be up on that first bench and they'll be just like looking down at you.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:19:30:02],00:19:54:11,"You hear them in the winter, You hear them probably, you know, at least twice a week in the night. And, you know, I go down there to feed the chickens and give them water and stuff with my dog. And my cats also join me usually. So I go on these like little walks with my dog and my cats and, you know, eyes going down there.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:19:54:11],00:20:44:10,"And there's there's wolves that they're looking at me and you're looking back at them and you're just, it feels so primal about it. And I think that's to me, that's kind of what wilderness brings, you know, is some sort of like primal relationship with like the, like, you know, game and place, yeah. So you know, that and that's kind of one of the reasons I like hunting lies is because you're, you're kind of in this like primal situation where you're like, senses are really attuned and, you know, it's, it's different than just going out for a hike.",wolves;wilderness
Andrew Armstrong,[00:20:44:12],00:21:11:12,"So it's, yeah, you know, you're part of it out here. You know, you're, you know, the predators realize that you're out here in the game, you realize you're out here and you know, in some way you are, you know, the deer kind of they're not scared of you at all. And they I think they find sanctuary here. And, you know, I don't think they'll find things right here.",wonder
Andrew Armstrong,[00:21:11:12],00:21:21:16,"They're just maybe with this haystack that's here, they'll find sanctuary here. But, but, you know, I don't know. You're just part of it all.",
Jack Kredell,[00:21:21:18],00:21:35:01,So you think the wolves looking down from that bench see you as a as a fellow predator or less prey?,wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:21:35:02],00:21:58:20,"I think they're just mostly interested. You know, they don't recognize us prey. And I think they they're pretty smart. They recognize you as something that they don't really want to mess with you. No, I didn't. When I was doing all these, like, skis up and down the canyon, I never had any, like, sort of protection. And I didn't have, like, a pistol or anything.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:21:58:20],00:22:38:10,"And I think I had, like, an air horn or something sometimes, I think maybe. I don't know. The thing about wolves is they're probably they're not going to they're not going to go after you. I mean, I know they've there's been some students who have been followed by by wolves and, you know, I think the was just interested in like what you are interested in learning if you are prey you know, they're not sure right away.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:22:39:14],00:23:13:20,"it's not like a grizzly bear that is definitely something to be concerned about. But, you know, it's hard to like not think about what an apex predator they are when you're like skiing up in this canyon and you look at their tracks and they're these just, like, huge tracks. They look like bigger than a horse. And you're trying to convince yourself that they're not as big as a horse when you're going up, because you know they're not.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:23:13:22],00:23:35:08,"But they've got these huge feet, you know, and so you're following these wolf tracks going this way. And you're wondering, you know, in the back of your mind, you're thinking, should I be continuing to go this way? And then you get to a killing. You know, it's just like carnage. You know, there's like especially they tend to make the kills.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:23:35:12],00:24:00:16,"I mean, on the creek. So there's just like wolf tracks everywhere. There's just like blood everywhere. And you think to yourself, right? You know, I'm just I'm a very small deer, you know, I don't know what it is that you recognize about humans that makes them realize that we're not, you know, prey. You know, I certainly I'm most scared about my dog.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:24:00:17],00:24:26:03,"And I, you know, I, I worry about them going after my dog. And, you know, after talking with the fish and game biologist, it seems like it's pretty reasonable to be worried about my dog, even if I'm right there. But I mean, they're the wolves or wolves are king in the winter here, you know, mountain lions stay away from them.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:24:26:05],00:24:54:01,"So I think I went up to last year, I went up to a Cabin creek and I, I saw like, I don't know if it's a wolf or dog or wolf or a coyote up there, but I saw this like animal coming down and I just I turned around. What about I don't know. I just must be a wuss for them.",wolves
Andrew Armstrong,[00:24:54:03],00:25:06:16,"There's something primal about me. It says like, you know, I'm a small deer. So.",
Jack Kredell,[00:25:06:18],00:25:59:13,"Yeah. One thing I'm fascinated about is that you have never tested in a cutting edge area of material science, and yet you are you are here in the deepest Idaho backcountry making a living. And I'm wondering why you chose this, you know? Well, like what? What drew you to this place?",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:26:01:14],00:26:10:20,"Well, I guess my mom would probably ask that same question.",
Jack Kredell,[00:26:10:22],00:26:18:00,Would you say that?,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:26:18:02],00:26:33:13,"I don't know. You know, I don't know. I would say.",
Jack Kredell,[00:26:33:15],00:26:39:07,I would say that it is a it seems to run in your family.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:26:39:09],00:27:19:12,"Yeah. My mom would be probably, like, wanting me to become, like, a professional or professor or something like that. but yeah, I feel like a lot of ways this is like, who I am. You know, I've always felt a connection to the backcountry and also being out here. I think it depends what you do in science. You know, like, you know, progress for progress sake isn't necessarily like, I don't know, it's not that useful.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:27:19:14],00:27:40:11,"Like, you know, if you think of science out here at the wilderness, you know, yeah, there's a lot of very fancy scientific instruments that you can put out, but just, you know, putting them out for the sake of, like, collecting the data isn't like that important.",wilderness
Andrew Armstrong,[00:27:40:13],00:28:17:00,"You know, I, I actually want to do, like, nuclear engineering and, I was applying for jobs in know, to do because, I mean, I've always cared about climate change a lot, and trying to figure out solutions to climate change. I was a solar installer for a long time. I worked, work done like designing and building energy efficient buildings, whether it was from, like for, like the military or just for, like, you know, buildings here in McCall.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:28:20:18],00:28:58:14,"but, you know, I, I don't know, I started to think that maybe solar, it just seemed like there's so many panels that you need and we use so much energy is like a society. And I just it just felt like maybe nuclear was the best option to of maybe is it like one of the only it was almost the easy option you know you've already gotten is this way of making huge amount of power without carbon or you know I think that people's fear of radiation is like it's justified in some ways.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:28:58:14],00:29:27:20,"It's also like, you know, we're scared of the unknown. And I think that a lot of I feel like I feel like the whole like nuclear industry needed to be like kind of shooken up and like, fixed. So but I applied for like nuclear engineering and I didn't have any, like nuclear materials science background and, you know, so I just, you know, took what opportunity was given to me.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:29:27:20],00:29:56:08,"And that was all about that. And I wouldn't change it. But anyways, I, I don't know. I also don't know. I like to live out and I know for the not really, I, I hear that the, you know, the landscape around Idaho Falls is like, awesome, but it's really hot there. And I just, you know, I'm, I grew up and McCall's beautiful.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:29:56:08],00:30:19:04,"It's hard to like. It's hard to leave. I have this ranch. I have you know, I have this beautiful ranch. And this is like, hard to like. Imagine moving to Idaho Falls for like, a job, you know? So here at Taylor House, I have a beautiful ranch. And, you know, I don't know. I mean, I think I don't know.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:30:19:06],00:30:54:01,"It's hard to say. We'll just see what happens in the future. But, ultimately, I'm here because it's some combination of science and ranching and both of those things of I really like things. It's like, drive me, you know, even, even though the science is isn't necessarily in my field, you know, I know how to fix a data logger and, you know, I know how to and how this equipment works and I can like I can just make it work.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:30:54:01],00:31:33:13,"And I think there's a lot of value to keeping all this equipment running. And, you know, I don't know, it's kind of it's both technical and no use in my mind, fix things and stuff. So that's about it. On that regard, I really went on a tangent, but anyways, I also just really love the nature. I love watching these little hummingbirds do their tail fanning and you know, I don't know, it's a good place to be.",
Jack Kredell,[00:31:33:15],00:31:50:19,"I would say that your, your practical and technological expertise is why Taylor needs you, but I also get the sense that you need Taylor in some interesting way.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:31:50:21],00:32:17:18,"Well, I don't know. I don't really know what Taylor needs. I mean, well. Well, I, I do my best, but yeah, no, it's definitely a mix of, like, practical. You know, you're sitting out there moving irrigation and you're sitting there and you're, you know, connecting pipes and whatnot and, you know, doing like, I really actually like electrical work.",water
Andrew Armstrong,[00:32:17:18],00:32:49:00,"So I do a lot of, like electrical work and I have done a bunch of solo work in the past. So I understand like how as off grid systems work, but yeah, I mean, I took the job partly because I was, you know, my dad, you, his whole life was built on using team wheels to like, build backcountry projects.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:32:49:00],00:33:12:21,"So he built, I don't know exactly, but about 200 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, he built a bunch of other trails as well. And growing up, you know, I remember you know, I just remember growing up and we were building trail and we were, you know, I summer run, you know, my dad would tell me to we're going to do a dynamite charge.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:33:12:21],00:33:59:20,"And we'd go and I'd go and run away and find some rock to hide behind or something like that. And so I don't know. I mean, in some ways, you know, just kind of honoring the family business, you know? Well, not just, you know, I don't really care about business, but just, you know, I feel I feel like I'm just kind of, you know, in this like modern world.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:33:59:20],00:34:23:02,"How do you how do you say, tree roots? And you've got to kind of be creative and or whatever. Know, you just got to take the opportunities that you've gotten here. I have an opportunity to work with Stark and kind of figure that out and see if that's something I'm interested in doing. So that's what I got, right?",creativity
Andrew Armstrong,[00:34:23:04],00:34:25:11,So you should do this before I drink whiskey.,
Jack Kredell,[00:34:25:13],00:35:03:15,"That's good. Yeah, that was really good. well, you're about to, manage a number of students who are coming to Taylor in the fall for a class for the law. And I'm. I'm wondering how you anticipate what this experience will mean to that.",
Jack Kredell,[00:35:07:11],00:35:10:08,What is the value of a place like Taylor for.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:35:10:10],00:35:11:11,Your students.,
Jack Kredell,[00:35:11:16],00:35:20:23,Students and especially students who are doing this type of life in the backcountry?,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:35:21:01],00:36:10:16,"Well, I know you know, I think that growing up, I took for granted what it meant to be back here and, I don't know. You know, I'll just say that when you're living in town or city or something like that, the days seem pretty short because you're so is this like there's always many things going on. You know, you're I don't know, you've got Internet, you're driving places, you're doing all these things and it's like super busy, busy way.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:36:10:18],00:36:36:16,"And you come back here and the days are really long. You know, you get up, you get up early, especially in the in the summer because it's hot and you get up early. And if you go to do anything, you're going to be in the morning. I don't know. I mean everything, but it's on for like in anyways.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:36:36:18],00:37:06:17,"What was the question again? What is it going to mean to the students? Yeah, well, one of the things I most appreciate is just going for like a hard hike or something like that. And, like, if you go for a hard hike, you know, you see a huge amount of country, you learn so much about the country, you see all these new places.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:37:06:22],00:37:46:06,"It's a huge amount of adventure. You know, there's always different things that happen that you're not expecting and you kind of overcome and, just figure it out and you just become really self-reliant. And, I think that anyone that comes here to some extent learns that. But if you're back here for a whole semester, you for sure going to learn that and just that, you know, endorphins you get after some experience that you're like just totally out of your comfort zone.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:37:46:08],00:38:15:07,"That's what I like. I like, you know, what I like the most is going out, getting lost, and then just kind of checking my way back until I find some place where I know where I am or something or, you know, just Yeah, I mean, I just, you know, I think that's one of the things about a venture is you go out and you don't know what you're doing, and you just kind of figure it out.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:38:15:09],00:38:51:11,"So hopefully, you know, it's kind of like all the life, you know, you're just figuring things out, you know, life is always the world is always changing. You just got to kind of move on from that in the right direction, which is not always known, but be confident in like being okay and unknown places. And I think whatever your walk in life, you if you're comfortable being kind of in uncertain situations, it will benefit you.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:38:51:16],00:39:20:22,"And I hope that all students learn that. And you know, our intern, she she sure learned that and she had a great time back here. And, you know, she she kind of it was only like a month and a half, but it really changed her. And I think, yeah, that's kind of what I'm hoping. You know, it's just that type of skill.",
Jack Kredell,[00:39:21:00],00:39:25:08,Now is good because there is a good segment.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:39:25:16],00:39:30:00,good confidence.,
Jack Kredell,[00:39:30:02],00:39:34:21,"You know, no lessons.",
Unknown,[00:39:52:17],00:39:53:03,I don't really.,
Jack Kredell,[00:39:53:03],00:39:54:17,"Have anything else, so let's hear something.",
Jack Kredell,[00:40:04:19],00:40:18:02,"I said, I'm curious as to how you see yourself in. In the tradition of caretakers.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:40:18:04],00:40:51:05,"Well, I feel that there's a lot of weight on my shoulders. You know, I have this picture of Jess Taylor up there in the Taylor cabin, and here I am on his chair. You know, to me, I live like I live in their footsteps and, you know, in that way, you know, like this chair. When I first got here, it was broken like the rocker.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:40:51:07],00:41:25:10,"I don't know if I can see it, but it's it was like the chair was broken and, you know, just Taylor was renowned because he and what I mean, he's renowned for various things. But one of the things he did is he basically he repurposes old airplane crash at a soldier bar and he packed all this like airplane stuff so that there's various airplane stuff, you know, from the trapdoor to my attic to the smoker to his packed frame.",aviation
Andrew Armstrong,[00:41:25:10],00:41:56:14,"You know, that's all of these like aluminum aircraft parts. And, you know, I was just thinking, you know, what would just. Taylor how would he like his chair fixed? And I thought, you know, so I just found some more of that aircraft running around because there's parts all over and I can adjust fashions and sort of splice with this with aluminum from that old plane and, you know, rocks pretty good now.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:41:56:16],00:42:20:21,"But, you know, I don't know, it's kind of hard because, you know, just to well, first of all, you know, the Sheepeater Indians, how are you ever going to how you ever going to like, you know, understand the country as well as they did? How are you ever going to you know, we're not you know, I, I survive on the main plane that comes here, you know, and brings me groceries and stuff.",indigenous
Andrew Armstrong,[00:42:20:22],00:42:48:22,"I don't survive on the sheep and the land. you know, Dave Lewis, he he knew this country he was back here for. It was like 60 years or something. He just he knew this country so well, and he and, you know, quite a hunter and, you know, but here I am in the Jess Taylor cabin, and I feel some sort of affinity to him because he's kind of he likes to build things that aircraft says.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:42:48:23],00:43:27:03,"I figure he's kind of a tinkerer, but, you know, he's used a I know he's a pretty strong personality who kind of expected the best out of people. And I guess I got this picture of him up there and every day kind of reminds me that, you know, I don't know, what would he do? though I think he was a really hard worker and he was pretty accomplished.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:43:27:03],00:44:15:02,"And then, you know, there were the Jim and Holly, and they're pretty much I think that that's one of the hardest things, like comparing myself to them, because they were both like professional biologists and they did such a good job back here. and their vision for Taylor was pretty compelling of but you know, they were both like these big game biologists, and it was also kind of a different time where, you know, you could just go out and, you know, fairly easily tranquilize an animal and do research on it and not have a huge amount of bureaucracy involved with that.",legacy
Andrew Armstrong,[00:44:15:03],00:44:42:20,"You know, so I mostly look towards like just Taylor and the Arkansans. there were also the guys who lived here and they don't inspire me. No, that's not true, but that's kind of true. So. Well, you can edit that part out.",
Jack Kredell,[00:44:42:22],00:44:50:22,I think. I think I think Jim Atkins in particular would be happy with the recent addition of stuff.,
Andrew Armstrong,[00:44:51:00],00:45:18:09,"Well, I think they both would. I mean, Holly was pretty into me just getting even like an anything on here, you know? And, you know, Jim was like an amazing hunter, you know, the idea of taking elk with a primitive bow that he built is just like, you know, hopefully this year I will hunt with a primitive bow for deer.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:45:18:15],00:45:33:01,I feel like I can get a deer. There's no way I could get milk. No way. But I might be able to get a deer. So that'll be fun.,
Jack Kredell,[00:45:33:03],00:45:57:06,"You mentioned that you you read their book and you really liked it, and then you read it a second time and you also really liked it. And it was because you had been immersed in the landscape that they're describing in the book. It impacted you so much that the second time around.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:45:57:08],00:46:27:14,"Yeah, yeah. So the first time I read it, you know, I knew Jim and Holly from before. I hadn't read their book, but I applied for this job and I heard I think I just assumed that I was going to get interviewed. And so I figured, you know, I better start with at least a little bit of literature about kind of what the job entails before I do the interview.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:46:27:16],00:47:05:03,"So, you know, I read it and I found it pretty fascinating. but recently, you know, I've been here for basically in two days it will be one year now that I've been here. And, you know, I, it's just I read the book again, and I. And I know all these places, you know, and he said that he's a mountain lion, like he had some juvenile mountain lions that they had released, and they were up in these cliffs past the lower pasture.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:47:05:05],00:47:31:07,"And they just you know, we're talking about how they're really steep and gnarly. And I mean, these are cliffs which I've always looked at. I've always been like, wow, why would I ever go up there? I mean, you know, I don't know. It's just like you start to realize that, you know, you just start to see, like, what these what these places that we're talking about are whether it's, you know, Monumental Creek and going up there or.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:47:31:09],00:48:07:12,"Yeah, I mean, just I don't know, it's just some sort of, you know, time you read it and, you know, all these places, it's it's a whole different experience. And you really see like, you know, what they're talking about. But yeah, I mean, I've always thought about these cliffs and I've kind of explored through them a little bit, but that's kind of one of the cool things about hunting or also just the research that you're doing is just, you know, you would you never choose to go after go up there unless you're like trying go up there for some reason, you know?",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:48:07:12],00:48:33:07,"And, yeah, so, but you know, I mean dealing with their water sources and how they would deal with their creeks and stuff, you just find a lot of little tricks They didn't pick up on before because. Yeah, that was a very good answer. But me, I did. I did try.",
Jack Kredell,[00:48:33:09],00:49:00:03,"No, that's good. This is a good, I think I mean, we've been talking for 45 minutes. We can wrap it up and I suppose, like, I would like, unless you get to say something that.",
Andrew Armstrong,[00:49:00:05],00:49:04:16,I don't know. I can read.,
