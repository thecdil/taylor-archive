Maurice Hornocker,[00:00:08:12],"But we turned loose up there under the tower, and it went down to the mouth of Rush Creek, crossed Big Creek, went three quarters of the way up Horse Mountain, angled around into Cliff Creek and over.

Maurice Hornocker,[00:01:59:15],"Because we didn't have facilities at Taylor that first winter, but we did at Cabin Creek. But anyway, we went down and, no tracks on the trail. Nothing.
