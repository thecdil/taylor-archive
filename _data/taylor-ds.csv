One of the largest Wilderness areas in the contiguous U.S. and Dr. Maurice Hornocker’s research on this Wilderness’ enigmatic carnivore, the Mountain Lion, sealed its allure. The serendipity of place and my fortuitous introduction to Maurice led to my pursuit for PhD Studies at Taylor Ranch on Bobcat ecology during the early 1980s. This pristine natural laboratory was a perfect setting for unraveling the mystery of this little cat where their populations and environment were minimally impacted by man.  After receiving my degree and intrigued to explore more remote areas of the world and their native felids I ventured to the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of Kenya to study African lions and later to Mongolia and Nepal to study snow leopards. Returning to Washington I embarked on a suburban study area, where cougars, otherwise known as Mountain Lions, and humans appeared to co-exist with few conflicts.

Despite their small size, springs provide disproportionately large ecological benefits to the surrounding landscape through the consistent flow of groundwater. Springs are difficult to study because of their small size on the landscape and remote access. Consequently, it is estimated that over 50% of springs in the western United States are unmapped, and in wilderness areas, the percentage is significantly less. This has resulted in a limited understanding of how spring ecosystems contribute to landscape scale ecological function, biodiversity, and climate change resilience. Grace’s research involves traversing the mountains around TWRS to map springs, measure the stability of spring flow in response to changing snowpack, and understand how springs facilitate forest regeneration following wildfire.",2022-07-29,"July 29, 2022",rivers;research;springs;ecology,Taylor Wilderness Research Station,45.1028,-114.8517,phd student;,Voices of Taylor - Jack Kredell Interview Project funded by the U of I Library and the College of Natural Resources,,,"In Copyright.
